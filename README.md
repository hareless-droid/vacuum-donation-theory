Analogue QFT model linking Kerr-media symmetry# Vacuum Donation Theory: Kerr-Driven Analogue Quantum Field Theory

## Project Summary
This repository contains the theoretical framework and QuTiP simulation source code supporting the "Vacuum Donation Theory," a novel mechanism for **hierarchical quantum signal amplification** via engineered symmetry breaking in Kerr nonlinear resonators.

The core finding is the **mathematical isomorphism** between this effect and **chiral symmetry breaking in superfluid Helium-3 ($\text{}^{3}\text{He-A}$)**, bridging quantum optics, condensed matter physics (analogue gravity), and axion dark matter searches ($\text{ADMX}$).

## Key Theoretical Claims
1.  **Vacuum Donation:** The $\mathbf{H_{\text{sb}}}$ operator ($\lambda_{\text{sb}}=0.03$) acts as a donation channel, selecting and stabilizing one ground state, leading to robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking.
2.  **Amplification:** Numerical simulations (QuTiP) show a $\mathbf{51.5\text{x}}$ enhancement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($\text{SNR}$).
3.  **Analogy:** The Kerr Hamiltonian is an effective low-energy description of the $\text{}^{3}\text{He}$-A phase, suggesting a universal principle of vacuum topology.

## Repository Contents
* **`main.tex`**: The $\text{arXiv}$ submission source code (The full $\text{PRL}$-style paper).
* **`qutip_kerr_symmetrybreak.py`**: The fully annotated Python code for the numerical verification.
* **`README.md`**: This project overview.

## 🤝 Call for Collaboration
We are seeking experimental groups with expertise in:
1.  **Circuit QED Resonators (cQED):** For rapid verification of the predicted $\text{SNR}$ enhancement and squeezing signatures.
2.  **Superfluid $\text{}^{3}\text{He}$ Low-Temperature Physics:** For testing the analogue gravitational and chiral defect formation predictions.
3.  **Axion/Weak-Force Detection:** For theoretical comparison with the $\text{ADMX}$ sensitivity bounds.

Please contact the author for joint proposal writing and experimental design. breaking to $\text{}^{3}\text{He}$ chiral topology.
